# WorldWise 🌍

WorldWise is a travel tracking web application that allows you to keep track of the cities and countries you've visited around the world. Click on the interactive map to add cities, write notes about your experiences, and build your personal travel journal.

This project was built as part of learning advanced React concepts (following Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React Course).

## Features

- Interactive world map (using React Leaflet) to select and mark visited cities
- Add, edit, and delete cities with custom notes and visit dates
- Country information automatically fetched from an API
- Persistent data using fake authentication and local storage
- Clean and modern UI with custom CSS

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with Hooks: useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext)
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development server
- **React Router** – For client-side routing (pages: Home, Pricing, Product, Login, App Layout, Cities List, City Details, Form)
- **React Leaflet** – Interactive maps
- **Context API** – Global state management for cities and authentication
- **LocalStorage** – Data persistence
- **CSS Modules / Styled Components** (depending on your implementation)
- Other libraries: date-fns, react-icons, etc.
